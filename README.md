# LandingPageUdacity
This project is a multi-section landing page. 
The navigation bar is built dynamically. The code checks which section is currently in the viewport and highlights it's title in the navigation bar and also make changes in the section itself to show that it is currently the one in the viewport. 
There's also a non-default scrolling function that takes you smoothly to the required section when you click on its title in the navigation bar.
This project is built using HTML,CSS, and JavaScript.
